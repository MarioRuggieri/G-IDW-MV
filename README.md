# GPGPU Inverse Distance Weighting
A parallel GPU version of the IDW interpolation algorithm using matrix-vector multiplication [1].

* custom_version -> matrix vector multiplication using a thread for each scalar product

* cuBLAS_version -> cuBLAS matrix vector multiplication

Language: C, Framework: CUDA 8.0, cuBLAS v2

# Installation and Usage 

`src/demo.cu` is an example of usage on random data. It launches the CPU and GPU algorithms and shows for both the execution time.

**Demo installation**
  ```
  cd src
  make
  ```
In this way you are making `demo` binary file
	
**Demo usage**

* 1th argument: type of usage (1 = file, 2 = random data)

* 2th argument: (type 1) known 3D points dataset file / (type 2) number of known values

* 3th argument : (type 1) 2D locations file / (type 2) number of values to interpolate

* 4th argument : number of query locations per iteration

* 5th argument : number of CUDA block threads

* 6th argument: search radius

Examples:

	./demo 1 dataset.txt grid.txt 5000 256 400
	./demo 2 20000 300000 5000 256 400
	
CPU and GPU output are saved into the current directory.

Each line of the dataset file must have this layout: longitude;latitude;z;

For example:

	13.70104167;40.84895833;-702.20;
	13.70312500;40.84895833;-700.20;
	...

Each line of the grid file (query locations) must have this layout: longitude;latitude;

For example:

	13.70104167;40.55104167;
	13.70154225;40.55104167;
	...
	
Software uses single-precision floating-points.
