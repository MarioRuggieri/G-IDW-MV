# Parallel GPU Inverse Distance Weighting
A parallel GPU version of the IDW interpolation algorithm [1] using matrix-vector multiplication.

* custom_version -> matrix vector multiplication using a thread for each scalar product

* cuBLAS_version -> cuBLAS matrix vector multiplication

Language: C, Framework: CUDA 8.0

# Installation and Usage 

`src/demo.cu` is an example of usage on random data. It launches the CPU and GPU algorithms and shows for both the execution time.

**Demo installation**
  ```
  cd src
  make
  ```
In this way you are making `demo` binary file
	
**Demo usage**

* 1th argument: number of known points

* 2th argument: number of values to interpolate

* 3th argument : number of CUDA block threads

Example:

	./demo 10000 1000 100
