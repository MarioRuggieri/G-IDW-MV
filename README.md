# GPGPU Inverse Distance Weighting
A parallel GPU version of the IDW interpolation algorithm [1] using matrix-vector multiplication.

* custom_version -> matrix vector multiplication using a thread for each scalar product

* cuBLAS_version -> cuBLAS matrix vector multiplication

Language: C, Framework: CUDA 8.0, cuBLAS v2

# Installation and Usage 

`src/demo.cu` is an example of usage on random data. It launches the CPU and GPU algorithms and shows for both the execution time.

**Demo installation**
  ```
  cd src
  make
  ```
In this way you are making `demo` binary file
	
**Demo usage**

* 1th argument: type of usage (1 = file, 2 = random data)

* 2th argument: (type 1) known 3D points dataset file / (type 2) number of known values

* 3th argument : (type 1) 2D locations file / (type 2) number of values to interpolate

* 4th argument : number of locations per iteration

* 5th argument : number of CUDA block threads

Examples:

	./demo 1 dataset.txt locations1k.txt 1000 80
	./demo 2 1000 1000 500 80
	
* dataset.txt contains a dataset of 45147 3D points
* locations1k.txt contains 1000 2D locations to calculate values
* locations200k.txt contains 219076 2D locations to calculate values
